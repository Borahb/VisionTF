# VisionTF

This is a  Flutter Project which is integrated with tenserflowlite to detect objects in images. Here I have used two pretrained models that is ssdmobile net and yolov2_tiny.

## Getting Started

Some of the screenshots are below :

<img src = "assets/2.jpg" height = 500> <img src = "assets/6.jpg" height = 500>  <img src = "assets/3.jpg" height = 500> <img src = "assets/4.jpg" height = 500>
<img src = "assets/5.jpg" height = 500>  <img src = "assets/1.jpg" height = 500>
